#GOOGLE BOOKS THING

This application lets you search for books with the Google Books API. Once you search for a book, you can add it to a list of saved books you'd like to read. You can view that list of books later, and leave reviews for books that you read. Well, maybe. I might not implement that feature in the first go-round, but it would be cool.
